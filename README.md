## ABOUT THE PROJECT

```
In this project, a novel Transformerless DC-DC
converter with high gain is implemented. The voltage Gain of the
converter implemented in this project is higher than traditional
buck-boost, boost, SEPIC, CUK and ZETA converters. Another
advantage of this proposed topology is that there is only one switch
to control the converter thus resulting in reduced conduction
losses which results in improved efficiency of the converter. Modes
of operation and steady state analysis of the converter will be
performed and results will be verified through simulation using
MATLAB/Simulink. Furthermore, a PI-controller will be
implemented to reduce the over-shoot of the converter.
